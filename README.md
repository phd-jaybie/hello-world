Just another hello-world activity, i.e. repository

Hi Everyone!

Phd-Jaybie here. I'm a student at PhD UNSW doing work on Security and Privacy on Mixed Reality.
I honestly have no idea what I am supposed to do.
Nevertheless, I am creating this git repo or account to safely store all my codes for my PhD.

(As of 23-May-2017) I am currently doing some Android development work on a basic AR app that
captures images through a device's camera and, hopefully, process this images to detect "known" objects using OpenCV.
I ahve never worked on OpenCV nor developed an app for Android. So, you see, I am treadin on unknown territory.

Well, not completely unknown, I have some background on machine learning and deep learning which is used by OpenCV
and other similar image and vision processing software, so, yeah, not really completely in the dark.

Now, let's see where this takes me. Au revoir to me!
